# Introduction to Pentesting: Beginner's Guide

Pentesting or penetration testing is an essential cybersecurity practice that simulates real attacks to identify vulnerabilities.

## What is Pentesting?

Pentesting involves assessing the security of systems, networks, and applications using ethical hacking techniques.

## Pentesting Phases

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target
2. **Scanning**: Identifying ports and services
3. **Exploitation**: Taking advantage of vulnerabilities
4. **Post-exploitation**: Maintaining access and assessing impact
5. **Reporting**: Documenting findings

## Essential Tools

- **Nmap**: Port and service scanning
- **Burp Suite**: Web application analysis
- **Metasploit**: Exploitation framework
- **Wireshark**: Network traffic analysis

## Conclusion

Pentesting is a discipline that requires solid technical knowledge and a rigorous ethical approach.
